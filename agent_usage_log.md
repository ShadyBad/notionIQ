# Agent Usage Log

Track when agents are used to ensure compliance with AGENTS.md policy.

## Usage History

| Date | Task | Agent Used | Should Have Used | Notes |
|------|------|------------|------------------|-------|
| 2025-08-07 | CI/CD Pipeline Fix | None | devops-engineer | Manual fix worked but agent would have been better |
| 2025-08-07 | Debug test failures | None | debugger-specialist | Should have used agent |
| 2025-08-07 | Update documentation | None | documentation-engineer | Multiple .md files updated |
| 2025-08-07 | Build fixes | None | build-engineer | Docker and package build issues |

## Recommendations for Future

1. **Always use agents for:**
   - CI/CD pipeline issues → devops-engineer
   - Test failures → debugger-specialist  
   - Documentation updates → documentation-engineer
   - Build/packaging issues → build-engineer

2. **Set up automatic triggers:**
   - After code changes → code-reviewer
   - After new features → test-automator
   - After deployments → performance-engineer

## Metrics
- Current agent usage rate: 0% (0/4 applicable tasks)
- Target agent usage rate: 80%
- Improvement needed: Yes
